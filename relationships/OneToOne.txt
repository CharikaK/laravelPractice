One to One
A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. A User has ONE phone. The Phone is BELONGSTO a user.

User 
User Model and the migration files are already exist

Migrate fresh to create the user table
php artisan migrate:fresh 

Now add fake users to the table
- make the factory files - factory sets the rules for the table fields
php artisan make:factory UserFactory --model=User

- make the UserTableSeeder
php artisan make:seed UserTableSeeder
in run() add 'User::factory()->count(3)->create();'

- seed into the table
php artisan db:seed --class=UserTableSeeder

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phone
create Phone model, migration, factory and seeder files
$ php artisan make:model Phone -mfs

edit phone model with mass assignment

edit the migration file with additional fields

migrate all the files
php artisan migrate:fresh

phone factory
- create faker custom array of phone names and let Laravel pick names randomly
  when creating records

seeder
- create records

seeding - this can be done is two ways
1 - 
    Edit DatabaseSeeder run() as in example
    php artisan db:seed

2 - 
    Edit PhoneSeeder run()
    php artisan db:seed --class=PhoneSeeder
